# Setup
Here, I will outline my goals for this analysis, load the data, preprocess it, share the data dictionary, etc.

## Guiding Question
Are there any characteristics that can help us predict whether a given person prefers mountains or beaches? (i.e. could we predict the answer to the question 'are you a mountain or a beach person')

## Intended Audience
The intended audience is anyone who feels strongly about mountains or beaches.

## Link to Data
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jahnavipaliwal/mountains-vs-beaches-preference

```{python}
# import kagglehub

# # Download latest version
# path = kagglehub.dataset_download("jahnavipaliwal/mountains-vs-beaches-preference")

# print("Path to dataset files:", path)

```

I have moved the file to the data folder

# Analysis
The actual analysis starts here. I want to use logistic regression to predict the label of 1-mountains or 0-beaches. To do this, I must respect the assumptions made for logistic regression, which I will tackle in the Data wrangling/Preprocessing section.

## Data wrangling/Preprocessing
Here are the assumptions:

* Binary Outcome Variable: Logistic regression is used for binary classification, so your dependent variable should be binary (e.g., 0 or 1, True or False).

* Independence of Observations: The observations should be independent of each other. No observation should influence another.

* No Perfect Multicollinearity: The predictor variables should not be perfectly correlated with each other. High multicollinearity can make it difficult to determine the individual effect of each predictor.

* Large Sample Size: Logistic regression requires a sufficiently large sample size to produce reliable results. As a rule of thumb, you should have at least 10-20 cases per predictor variable.

* No Significant Outliers: Outliers can unduly influence the model. Itâ€™s important to check for and potentially address outliers in your data.

* Observations Need to be Properly Distributed Across the Levels of the Dependent Variable: There should be a reasonable number of cases in both categories of the dependent variable. Extreme imbalances can lead to a biased model.
