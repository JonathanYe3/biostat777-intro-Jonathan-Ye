        "The actual analysis starts here. I want to use logistic regression to predict the label of 1-mountains or 0-beaches. To do this, I must respect the assumptions made for logistic regression, which I will tackle in the Data wrangling/Preprocessing section.\n",

        "## Data wrangling/Preprocessing\n",
        "Here are the assumptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Binary Outcome Variable: Logistic regression is used for binary classification, so your dependent variable should be binary (e.g., 0 or 1, True or False).\n",
        "\n",
        "* Independence of Observations: The observations should be independent of each other. No observation should influence another.\n",
        "\n",
        "* No Perfect Multicollinearity: The predictor variables should not be perfectly correlated with each other. High multicollinearity can make it difficult to determine the individual effect of each predictor.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Large Sample Size: Logistic regression requires a sufficiently large sample size to produce reliable results. As a rule of thumb, you should have at least 10-20 cases per predictor variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "* No Significant Outliers: Outliers can unduly influence the model. Itâ€™s important to check for and potentially address outliers in your data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Observations Need to be Properly Distributed Across the Levels of the Dependent Variable: There should be a reasonable number of cases in both categories of the dependent variable. Extreme imbalances can lead to a biased model.\n",
