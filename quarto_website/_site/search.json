    "text": "In greater detail, I am a student who enjoys learning new math and coding sometimes. Public health is interesting, I think it is good to think about research in the context of things that matter a great deal to the general population. I think researchers and scientists tend to only focus on their research/science, and neglect other factors that are also important to consider. For example, I hear a lot of people say that policymakers should just do what science tells them to do, but there are several other things to keep in mind. Feasibility, budget, ethics, and much more are also important.\nI am currently applying to graduate schools for PhD and also industry jobs, because I would like to have options of what to do next after undergrad. I am interested primarily in the health sector because I think it could be fulfilling, and am looking for data science jobs because that’s where most of my skills lie. I lack in biology/chemistry knowledge (definitely in terms of coursework) so I am hoping to get hired based on technological skillset."

    "text": "Data wrangling/Preprocessing\nHere are the assumptions:\n\nBinary Outcome Variable: Logistic regression is used for binary classification, so the dependent variable should be binary (e.g., 0 or 1, True or False).\n\nThis assumption is met by our dataset.\n\nIndependence of Observations: The observations should be independent of each other. No observation should influence another.\n\nThis assumption should be met, based on how the data was collected. Hopefully the participants are from different families.\n\nNo Perfect Multicollinearity: The predictor variables should not be perfectly correlated with each other. High multicollinearity can make it difficult to determine the individual effect of each predictor.\n\nWe will need to check this assumption.\n\nLarge Sample Size: Logistic regression requires a sufficiently large sample size to produce reliable results.\n\nWith a sample size of 5244 and 13 predictors, this assumption is more than met. In fact, we can even consider adding a couple of features from nonlinear combinations of our original 13 predictors, and still be fine.\n\nNo Significant Outliers: Outliers can influence the model, since Logistic regression minimizes a loss function - and outliers introduce too much loss that the model can try to correct for.\n\nWe will need to check this assumption.\n\nObservations Need to be Properly Distributed Across the Levels of the Dependent Variable: There should be a reasonable number of cases in both categories of the dependent variable. Extreme imbalances can lead to a biased model.\n\nWe will need to check this assumption.\nhttps://www.statisticssolutions.com/free-resources/directory-of-statistical-analyses/assumptions-of-logistic-regression/\n\nfeatures = dplyr::select(data, -Preference)\nhead(features)\n\n  Age     Gender Income Education_Level Travel_Frequency Preferred_Activities\n1  56       male  71477        bachelor                9               skiing\n2  69       male  88740          master                1             swimming\n3  46     female  46562          master                0               skiing\n4  32 non-binary  99044     high school                6               hiking\n5  60     female 106583     high school                5           sunbathing\n6  25       male 110588       doctorate                3           sunbathing\n  Vacation_Budget Location Proximity_to_Mountains Proximity_to_Beaches\n1            2477    urban                    175                  267\n2            4777 suburban                    228                  190\n3            1469    urban                     71                  280\n4            1482    rural                     31                  255\n5             516 suburban                     23                  151\n6            2895    urban                      6                   47\n  Favorite_Season Pets Environmental_Concerns\n1          summer    0                      1\n2            fall    0                      1\n3          winter    0                      0\n4          summer    1                      0\n5          winter    1                      1\n6            fall    0                      1\n\n\nIn order to use our categorical features, we must convert them to factors.

    "text": "Summary\nWe can see that our logistic regression was able to perfectly predict the preferences for our training data. This is pretty worthless because the error on the training data greatly underestimates the true error of our prediction function, and I did not save a test set because my goal was to identify which variables were the most important in influencing someone’s preference of mountains or beaches. Unfortunately, I can’t really accomplish that because none of the coefficients were statistically significant, which we can see in the summary of the coefficients. The P values are all greater than 0.5 (which is much too high). We can make some conclusions based on the size of the coefficients themselves, however. For example, large coefficients such as swimming and sunbathing as preferred activities make sense (-7.039e+03 and -7.038e+03). It also makes sense that factors such as education and gender are very insignificant predictors."
